STATUS: testing
APPROACH: Use TR8 A reads (0/256/512/768 + 1k/2k/3k offsets) and group-specific A packing derived from v_read_mapping.csv for tile0/1.
KEY_PARAMS: TR8 set offsets = {0,256,512,768} + {1024,1152,1280,1408} + {2048,2176,2304,2432} + {3072,3200,3328,3456}; lane groups 0/1 share mapping, 2/3 share mapping; k ordering per group follows gfx950 K=64 ranges.
TEST_RESULT:
  - V read dump: v_read_packed.csv shows k order 0..31 (tile0) and 32..63 (tile1)
  - Scaffold: identity-P rowid still incorrect (B mapping likely still wrong)
NEXT_STEP: Validate B operand mapping/order vs MFMA k layout with identity-P + V range masks, then adjust B packing.
